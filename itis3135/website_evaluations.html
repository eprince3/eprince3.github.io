                    <a href = "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/">National Geographic</a>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This website, belonging to National Geographic, contains publicly available information and resources to the
                    National Geographic product lineup: articles, newsletters, shows, podcasts, etc. This is a lot of information to
                    keep organized in one place, so let's take a look at how the CRAP principles apply to this website.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4><b>C:</b> Contrast</h4>
                        <p>
                            National Geographic has some appealing contrast in their site, but also some not-so-appealing contrast.
                            Starting off with a positive, the text size if very well done. I think the site header could be a little
                            bigger, but aside from that the text size flows with the content of the page. Scrolling down the page,
                            each segment also has clear contrast with the segments bordering above and below. Now for the negatives.
                            My main gripe with this page is the use of black and white. Although they do <em>technically</em>
                            contrast, the black in the background makes everything pop a little <em>too</em> much.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4><b>R:</b> Repetition</h4>
                        <p>
                            They've done a great job in this category. Although I find the infinite scroller site trope (I think
                            originally "coined" by Apple?) a little frustrating to navigate through time-wise, I can't deny that the
                            sections are well designed and, once reached, easily navigable.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4><b>A:</b> Alignment</h4>
                        <p>
                            There's not too much to say on this topic, as there isn't too much wrong to complain about.
                            The sub-headers are all centered, along with their captions, and the content beneath are sectioned off
                            in a clean and organized alignment.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4><b>P:</b> Proximity</h4>
                        <p>
                            Similar to alignment, there's not much to complain about here. Each section takes up 
                            nearly the entire webpage, and all the content is close in the center, with ample use of empty space
                            in the margins on either side. Each header is also close enough to its content to easily imply 
                            connection.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>
                    <a href = "http://www.skisugar.com/">Sugar Mountain Ski Resort</a>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Now, as both the URL implies, this site is in fact the website representing Sugar Mountain's Skiing (and Snowboarding)
                    information. This information, however, is unreasonably difficult to find from their main page. This site has been 
                    annoying me for years and I'm glad to get a crack at dissecting it.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4><b>C:</b> Contrast</h4>
                        <p>
                            Let's start with the color scheme. Since the most obvious component of the page is the massive
                            image header at the top, you'd think it would set some expectation for the color palette of the page, right?
                            Well that image actually changes every few seconds, with an animation reminiscent of template powerpoint
                            slide changes (in fact, it may even be one). Not only does it change constantly, but each image has an 
                            entirely different color palette present. That alone wouldn't be too bad, but if you look at the background
                            image of the site, you can see that it's opaqueness setting has been turned up. This would usually be great
                            for contrast, aside from the fact that the opaque scaling turns the top of the image into nearly the same 
                            color as the main section of the site. Goodbye contrast. Oh, also, the header and paragraph texts are
                            similar in size and identical in color, making it difficult to immediately distinguish sections.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4><b>R:</b> Repetition</h4>
                        <p>
                            There is too much wrong with this site to go into, so I'll just start listing some examples of
                            inconsistent repetition in the site. If you go to the "summer trail map" page, which is a
                            in a dropdown menu connected (though not immediately evident) to the "trail map" listing in the 
                            nav bar, it takes you to a downloadable pdf of the trail map. As opposed to the "winter trail map"
                            option, which takes you to an in-site map with no donwloadable map. If you take a look at all 
                            of the other dropdown menus, you can easilly see inconsistency in size and division of sections.
                            Most of the links there don't even take you to individual pages, some take you to subsections further
                            down the page. Oh, and if you click on the "summer activities", "winter activities", or "events"
                            buttons on the nav bar, they all take you to the same place: the events page.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4><b>A:</b> Alignment</h4>
                        <p>
                            Although most everything about this site is terrible, it's at least relatively consistent in how
                            terrible it is. Of course, there are a <em>lot</em> of pages to scour through, but in those that 
                            I've gone through, the alignment seems fine. Most of the crucial information is relegated to the 
                            left 2/3rds of the screen, with the right 1/3rd being left for less-related information.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4><b>P:</b> Proximity</h4>
                        <p>
                            For the items on each page, proximity is not too much of an issue. It gets a little
                            annoying once you get to pages with data, such as pricing, but for the most part
                            everything is in proximity to its related content. Now, if we're talking about the nav bar,
                            proximity goes out the window. They might as well have organized the nav bar alphabetically for 
                            how unintuitive the lists are. Every time I come to this website I'm looking for one of 2 things,
                            ticket prices or rental prices. The fact that I have to hover over every nav object and read through
                            10 or more entries for each before I can find these sections is a waste of my time. Instead of 
                            "TICKETS", or "RENTALS" being sections of their own, or at least at the top of the list, you have to
                            hover over "winter activities" to find sections labeled "individual ticket pricing", and "rental 
                            equipment and clothing".
