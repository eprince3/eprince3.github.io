                    <a href = "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/">National Geographic</a>
                    <p>
                        This website, belonging to National Geographic, contains publicly available information and resources to the
                        National Geographic product lineup: articles, newsletters, shows, podcasts, etc. This is a lot of information to
                        keep organized in one place, so let's take a look at how the CRAP principles apply to this website.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4><b>C:</b> Contrast</h4>
                            <p>
                                National Geographic has some appealing contrast in their site, but also some not-so-appealing contrast.
                                Starting off with a positive, the text size if very well done. I think the site header could be a little
                                bigger, but aside from that the text size flows with the content of the page. Scrolling down the page,
                                each segment also has clear contrast with the segments bordering above and below. Now for the negatives.
                                My main gripe with this page is the use of black and white. Although they do <em>technically</em>
                                contrast, the black in the background makes everything pop a little <em>too</em> much.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4><b>R:</b> Repetition</h4>
                            <p>
                                They've done a great job in this category. Although I find the infinite scroller site trope (I think
                                originally "coined" by Apple?) a little frustrating to navigate through time-wise, I can't deny that the
                                sections are well designed and, once reached, easily navigable.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4><b>A:</b> Alignment</h4>
                            <p>
                                There's not too much to say on this topic, as there isn't too much wrong to complain about.
                                The sub-headers are all centered, along with their captions, and the content beneath are sectioned off
                                in a clean and organized alignment.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4><b>P:</b> Proximity</h4>
                            <p>
                                Similar to alignment, there's not much to complain about here. Each section takes up 
                                nearly the entire webpage, and all the content is close in the center, with ample use of empty space
                                in the margins on either side. Each header is also close enough to its content to easily imply 
                                connection.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
