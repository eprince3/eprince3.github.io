            <br><p>Checklist:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    1. Design
                    <ul><li>
                        I love the color scheme of the site, it really matches the beachy vibe put up from the intro picture. I do wish that the useful links section was organized 
                        horizontally rather than vertically, though.
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    2. Header? Main? Footer?
                    <ul><li>
                        All are present, along with validation in the footer. Nice job.
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    3. Other Feedback
                    <ul><li>
                        The intro picture seems a bit large when compared to the text size underneath. I'm also having some problems navigating between the links that are in the site.
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
