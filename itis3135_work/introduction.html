                "Not a huge quote guy"

                * PERSONAL: pass

                * PROFESSIONAL : First job I worked at was a catering gig, and food service was too hectic for me. After that I worked briefly as an editor of safety documents at Safety Integrity AB (based out of Västerås, Sweden), and then later as a camp instructor for one-on-one coding camps at CodaKid, teaching kids between the ages of 6-16.

                * ACADEMIC: Ever since I took my first programming class in high school, I knew it was the track I was following. Since then I've been studying Computer Science at UNCC (and briefly, at NCSU).

                * PROGRAMMING/SOFTWARE: Although C# is my favorite to use so far, Java is the language I have the most experience in.

                * CLASSES:

                * MATH 2164 Matrices and Linear Algebra: Degree req.

                * ITSC 3146 Intro to Operating Systems and Networking: My high school networking teacher left a lot to be desired. My mom does network management at IBM so I'm kinda obliged to give this one another shot.

                * ITSC 3688 Computers and their Impact on Society: It's useful to know the consequences of your field of study before participating fully.

                * ITIS 3135 Web-Based App. Design and Development: I've never had experience with HTML before and wanted to learn.

                * ANTH 2131 Intro to Peace Conflict & Identity: Similar to ITSC 3688, it's useful to understand the fundamentals of human interaction before committing yourself to a career path that has an effect on said interactions.

                * ANTH 2151 Intro to Archaeology: Minor req.

                * GRADUATING: 2022

                * STORY/ITEM: pass
