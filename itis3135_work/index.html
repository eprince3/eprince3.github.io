                Introduction
            </h2>
                <em>I promise my passport photo is even worse</em>
                <br><br>"Not a huge quote guy"
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>PROFESSIONAL</strong> : First job I worked at was a catering gig, and food service was too hectic for me. After that I worked briefly as an editor of safety documents at Safety Integrity AB (based out of Västerås, Sweden), and then later as a camp instructor for one-on-one coding camps at CodaKid, teaching kids between the ages of 6-16.</li>
                    <li><strong>ACADEMIC</strong>: Ever since I took my first programming class in high school, I knew it was the track I was following. Since then I've been studying Computer Science at UNCC (and briefly, at NCSU).</li>
                    <li><strong>PROGRAMMING/SOFTWARE</strong>: Although C++ is my favorite to use so far, Java is the language I have the most experience in.</li>
                    <li><strong>CLASSES</strong>: 
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>MATH 2164 Matrices and Linear Algebra</strong>: Degree req.</li>
                            <li><strong>ITSC 3146 Intro to Operating Systems and Networking</strong>: My high school networking teacher left a lot to be desired. My mom does network management at IBM so I'm kinda obliged to give this one another shot.</li>
                            <li><strong>ITSC 3688 Computers and their Impact on Society</strong>: It's useful to know the consequences of your field of study before participating fully.</li>
                            <li><strong>ITIS 3135 Web-Based App. Design and Development</strong>: I've never had experience with HTML before and wanted to learn.</li>
                            <li><strong>ANTH 2131 Intro to Peace Conflict & Identity</strong>: Similar to ITSC 3688, it's useful to understand the fundamentals of human interaction before committing yourself to a career path that has an effect on said interactions.</li>
                            <li><strong>ANTH 2151 Intro to Archaeology</strong>: Minor req.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>GRADUATING</strong>: 2022</li>
                    <li><strong>From NC</strong></li>
